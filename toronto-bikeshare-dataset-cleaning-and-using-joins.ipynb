Bike Share stations are located in Toronto, East York, Scarborough, North York, York and Etobicoke.\n","\n","In our data analysis, we're diving into the world of bikeshare data, weather information, and station details. When we put these pieces together, we get a richer picture of how people use bikes in different conditions and locations.\n","\n","**Cleaning the Bikeshare Data:**\n","\n","Cleaning this data means we're making sure it's accurate and reliable. This way, our insights can be trusted, and decisions can be based on solid information.\n","\n","**Adding Stations:**\n","\n","Stations are like the hubs of the bikeshare network. Combining bikeshare data with station info helps us understand which stations are popular, how many bikes they can hold, and how efficiently the system is running. It's like putting a map to our data, showing where the action is happening.\n","\n","**Connecting with Weather Data:**\n","\n","Ever wondered how weather affects our daily activities, including bike rides? That's what we're exploring by merging bikeshare data with weather conditions. Does rain or sunshine impact how many people use bikes? By joining these datasets, we're getting a clear picture of how weather plays a role in bike-sharing trends.\n","\n","**Goal of the analysis**\n","\n","Ultimately, we're doing all of this to uncover insights that matter. Whether it's improving the user experience, managing stations better, or adapting to weather patterns, our goal is to make the bikeshare system more efficient and enjoyable for everyone involved."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"700a7bf7","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-10T14:37:33.109623Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-10T14:37:33.108926Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-10T14:37:35.675775Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-10T14:37:35.674963Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.592273,"end_time":"2024-03-10T14:37:35.678059","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-10T14:37:33.085786","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import
